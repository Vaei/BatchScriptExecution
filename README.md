# Batch Script Execution

Allows iterating multiple files, executing a script on each file, and optionally saving them. With powerful filtering options.

## Installation
On Windows, this goes in your `My Documents\maya\scripts\` folder

Create a folder named FloatingShelf and clone this repo into it, or download the repo and extract the files into it.

## Running the Script
Run this from the Maya script editor, or add it to a shelf as a python command, or a hotkey:
```py
from BatchScriptExecution import BatchScriptExecution as BSE
BSE.BatchScriptExecutionUI()
```
